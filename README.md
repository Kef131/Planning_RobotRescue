# Planning_RobotRescue
Project where I analyzed and abstracted how itâ€™s the process of rescuing with a robot (usually in RoboCup competences), and developed a logic program with DLV-K, where by only giving background knowledge and the actions of the robot, the program could resolve and show the best plan to complete a successful rescue.
